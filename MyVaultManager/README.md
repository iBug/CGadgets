# MyVaultManager

A slightly complicated program that maintains a database, and records your balance.

This is a (final) homework from a C programming language course.

A bug that I don't want to fix:

- The database file may not be interchangeable between different (32-bit and 64-bit POSIX) systems.

  However, it's OK to transfer between 32-bit Windows and 64-bit Windows.
